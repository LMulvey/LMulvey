### Hey, I'm Lee 👋

I’m a Technology Lead with [Critical Mass](https://www.criticalmass.com) and a mentor/instructor with [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca).

An avid cycle commuter with a keen interest in social issues, civic design, and learning about how we interact with the cities we love. While I'm semi-active on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/lmulvey) and my [blog](https://www.leemulvey.com/blog), don’t follow me if you don’t want to read my opinions ✌🏻
